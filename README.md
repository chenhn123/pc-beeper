Tiny console utility runs on windows that beeps motherboard speaker via WinRing0 driver IO port read/write feature. This utility only support hardware platforms that have **System Speaker** device (Some laptops may lack this device). 

You can check out this in Device Manager: Set **View** to **Resources by type**, then select **Input/Output (IO)**, checkout port 0x61, it should be **System Speaker**, otherwise this utility won't work on your platform.
